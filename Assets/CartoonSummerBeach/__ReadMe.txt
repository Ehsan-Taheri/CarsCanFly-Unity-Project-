Thanks for buying this Cartoon beach summer pack !


Here are a few precision :

- If you want dynamic lighting instead of baked lighting (more suitable for mobiles), you have to change the material type : In Export/MaterialsMobile  Select all material and change the shader to Diffuse or whatever you want ! 

- If you want a neat pixelated look, go to Textures, select all textures and change the filter mode to 'Point'


Thanks a lot, and don't hesitate to Rate & review my pack :)
