© 2019 - Jean Moreno
=============================

QUICK START
-----------
Select one of the following shader in your Material:
- Toony Colors Pro 2/Desktop
- Toony Colors Pro 2/Mobile
- Toony Colors Pro 2/Standard PBS
- Toony Colors Pro 2/Standard PBS (Specular)
Then select the features you want to enable (bump, specular, rim...), and the correct shader will automatically
be selected for you.

If using the Lightweight/Universal Render Pipeline, you will have to generate your own shaders using the Shader Generator 2.
You can also extract the LWRP Cat demo scene from the "Cat Demo LWRP.unitypackage" file.

Read the documentation for more information.

PLEASE LEAVE A REVIEW OR RATE THE PACKAGE IF YOU FIND IT USEFUL!
Enjoy! :)

- [Shader Generator 2] (LWRP/URP) Fixed shader compilation error when using features with world-space view direction (e.g. "Specular")
- [Shader Generator 2] Fixed shader compilation error when using `Min Max Threshold` ceiling mode with "Triplanar Mapping"
- [Shader Generator 2] `Custom Code` implementation: fixed reference bug and improved UI on referenced implementations
- [Shader Generator 2] Fixed tiling and scrolling calculation order which could result in animation pops for Texture implementations
- [Shader Generator 1] Fixed issues with non-US culture when using C# 4.x (when using constant float values in Shader Generator 1)
- [Shader Generator 2] Fixed issue that produced a warning for generated shaders
- Cat Demo Scene: fixed mesh references in Unity 2019.1+

2.4.1
- As of version 2.4.0, the "Shaders 2.0" folder has been renamed to "Shaders".
  Any shaders and files in "Shaders 2.0" or a sub-folder (e.g. "Variants") has to be moved there for the shaders to compile properly.
- Added HTML formatted changelog
- Fixed packed shaders that were unpacking in the wrong folder, causing an #include error

2.4.0
- Added "Shader Generator 2" beta: more flexible tool, with a fully-featured Lightweight/Universal Pipeline template
See the documentation to learn more!
- Added "Cat Demo LWRP" scene (extract it from the "Cat Demo LWRP.unitypackage" file)
- Shader Generator: Added "VertExmotion" support (under "Special Effects")
- Shader Generator: Enabled Dithered Shadows when using Alpha Testing with Dithered Transparency
- Shader Generator: fixed Outline in Single-Pass Stereo rendering mode (VR)
- Added 26 MatCap textures
- Reorganized the Textures folder
- Renamed the "Shaders 2.0" folder to "Shaders"
- Added namespaces for all TCP2 classes (except material inspectors for compatibility)
- Added .asmdef files for TCP2 scripts (Unity 2019.1+)

2.3.572
- Fixed compilation error on MacOS
- Fixed issues with non-US culture when using C# 4.x
- Regression fixed: Shader Generator: "Constant Size Outline" was broken, will take objects' scale into account again

2.3.571
- Shader Generator: "Default" template: fixed Specular Mask when using PBR Blinn-Phong or GGX models
- Shader Generator: "PBS" templates: fixed compilation issues on builds when using outlines
- Shader Generator: "Surface PBS" template: fixed Emission feature
- Shader Generator: "Water" template: fixed precision issue causing artifacts on some mobile platforms
- Shader Generator: fixed "Constant Size Outline" option so that it ignores objects' scale
- Shader Generator: UI fixes with inline features

2.3.57
- Shader Generator: upgraded "SRP/Lightweight" template to latest version (4.1.0-preview with Unity 2018.3.0b9)
- Shader Generator: "Default" template: fixed "Pixel MatCap" option when using a normal map with skinned meshes
- Shader Generator: always start with a new shader when opening the tool (don't load the last generated/loaded shader anymore)
- Added example MatCap textures
- Removed 'JMOAssets.dll', became obsolete with the Asset Store update notification system

2.3.56
- Shader Generator: added "Texture Blending" feature for "Surface PBS" template
- Shader Generator: fixed non-repeating tiling for "Texture Blending" in relevant templates
- Shader Generator: fixed masks for "Surface PBS" template (Albedo Color Mask, HSV Mask, Subsurface Scattering Mask)
- Added default non-repeating tiling noise textures

2.3.55
- Shader Generator: added "Silhouette Pass" option: simple solid color silhouette for when objects are behind obstacles
- Shader Generator: fixed fog for "Standard PBS" shaders in Unity 2018.2+
- Reorganized some files and folders

- Shader Generator: added more Tessellation options for "Default" template: Fixed, Distance Based and Edge Length Based
- Shader Generator: added Tessellation support for "Standard PBS" template
- Desktop/Mobile shaders: removed Directional Lightmap support for shaders, so that all variants can compile properly (max number of interpolators was reached for some combination in Unity 2018+)
- Mpbile shaders: disabled view direction calculated in the vertex shader, will be calculated in the fragment instead, so that all variants compile properly (slightly slower but it frees up one interpolator)
- Shader Generator: restored 'VertexLit' fallback for Surface PBS template, so that shadow receiving works by default

2.3.53
- Shader Generator: added "Shadow Color Mode" feature with "Replace Color" option to entirely replace the Albedo with the shadow color
- Shader Generator: updated GGX Specular to be more faithful to the Standard shader implementation
- Shader Generator: fixed GGX Specular when using Linear color space
